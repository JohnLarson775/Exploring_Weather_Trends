# Exploring_Weather_Trends


### Description
The goal of this project is to analyze local and global data in order to make observations about the similarities and differences of temperature trends. Exporting from a SQL database, calculating a rolling mean, and creating a helpful visualization are necessary steps to accomplish this goal.

`Exploring_Weather_Trends.pdf` details workflow and findings, as well as the SQL query that created the relevant csv files found in the `Data` folder.
